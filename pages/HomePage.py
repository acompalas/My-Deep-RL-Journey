Welcome to my Deep Reinforcement Learning Journey!  
This site documents my review of deep learning and reinforcement learning through code demos and notes.  
I mainly follow OpenAI's *Spinning Up as a Deep RL Researcher*, Andrew Ngâ€™s *Deep Learning Specialization*,  
and Columbia's *Decision Making and Reinforcement Learning*.

### Demos

#### ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning
- Feedforward: MNIST (MLP)
- CNNs: LeNet (MNIST), AlexNet, ResNet (CIFAR-10/Imagenet)
- RNNs: Karpathyâ€™s char-RNN (text generation)
- Transformers: BERT (MLM), GPT (next-token prediction)
- VAEs: MNIST latent space demo
- Diffusion: image denoising demo

#### ðŸ”¹ Tabular RL
- Multi-Armed Bandits: Slot machine demo
- Markov Decision Processes: notes only
- Monte Carlo Methods: notes only
- TD Learning: Monte Carlo, SARSA, Q-learning on GridWorld
- Function Approximation: TD(Î») with eligibility traces (GridWorld/Checkers + NN)

#### ðŸ”¹ Deep RL
